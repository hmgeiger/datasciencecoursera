This repo is for the final project of Getting and Cleaning Data, and is all about cleaning up FitBit data.

It should contain the following other files:

run_analysis.R- Script to make the tidy data set. The assignment says to "explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected", but I only have one script and it explains pretty well how it works just by properly named variables and comments within it.
CodeBook.md- Gives a more detailed description of the raw data set.
